    <h1>Music</h1>

    <p>Here are some tunes we recorded in Kane County:</p>
    <small>Click on the song title to listen to the song.</small>

    <p>Did I mention that these were recorded LIVE?  No mixing, no editing, just what you hear is (a little lesser than) how awesomely we performed, live!  Unfortunately the recording doesn't quite capture the magnificence.</p>

    <p>Listen, please.  Share with your friends.  The "unreleased materials" will eventually be made available for purchase.  For those with very, very deep pockets.  Praise God.</p>

    <p>Thanks for listening!  This is our gift to the world.  We love you!</p>

    <p>Look, I'm just going to start writing names: Tranden Warren.  Ozland Lonehill.  Steve Beagley.  AJ Williams.  Hobbit.  Craig.  T-Nez.  Austin "Red" Barker!  The most powerful drummer and band jammer to ever live, Randall "Aaron" Richmond.  Wow.  Muth.  John Nixon.  Kortney Stirland.  Give that man a Presidential medal.  Holy %^%, wow.  Greetings to our other brothers and sisters who also participated with us.  I will extend this list.  Please email me your info if you contributed.  Email me, Dave @ dnorton211153@gmail.com :)  Feel free to make this music your own and extend it, rip it, shred it, re-use it and turn it into the most valuable NFTs or Ozones or What-have-yous.  Just remember your roots.  With all its imperfections, tomfoolery, nasty coffee, crackling vocals, beautiful harmonies, and incredible rhythms.  These tracks were recorded live, very little filtering at all going on here, besides overcorrecting and messing levels on a few, and these thirty-three tracks are worth more than the combined national debt of all nations, more than the value of their individual and combined faith, love, and trust.  You couldn't pay me (or anybody else) enough.  So set new goals, invest in the $1USD government-issued pack of golden-standard cigarettes, use your energy in some productive way to make each dollar valuable, like it's well worth your time to bust your ass, push limits, step forward into new frontiers, invent new security procedures, or whatever, to protect, honor, and sustain life, beauty, innovation, create video games or web applications, shape models and all these wonderful things, because as great as it is, the physical Kingdom is still playing catch-up with the perfect spiritual Kingdom of You-Know-Who-Who.  Thank you, in His name.  Praise the Lord and his team.  Thank you!</p>
